# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis

## üìä Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing electric vehicle (EV) data to provide insights into the market size, technological advancements, and adoption trends. Using Tableau for visualization and Excel for data preprocessing, the project highlights key performance indicators (KPIs) to understand the distribution and growth of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).

## üìå Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to:

1. Analyze the growth and distribution of electric vehicles.
2. Understand the technological progress through the average electric range.
3. Evaluate the market share of BEVs and PHEVs.
4. Identify geographical and manufacturer-level adoption trends.

## üìà Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### 1. Total Vehicles
- Measure the overall number of electric vehicles (BEVs and PHEVs) to assess market size and growth.

### 2. Average Electric Range
- Calculate the average electric range to evaluate technological advancements and vehicle efficiency.

### 3. Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles
- Identify the total number of Battery Electric Vehicles.
- Calculate the percentage of BEVs relative to the total electric vehicles.

### 4. Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles
- Identify the total number of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles.
- Calculate the percentage of PHEVs relative to the total electric vehicles.
